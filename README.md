QA exercise using selenium

I would like to start off by saying that learning Selenium on the go like this was quite the challenge!  A lot of reading, trial and error and a ton of Googling was involved but it was definitely worth it as I now appreciate how powerful a tool it can be.  That said, numerous complications arose when attempting to program this little application.  Selenium often times slows down or even causes FireFox to crash, the application sometimes fails to find elements on the page which causes errors, if this occurs re-run the application.  I believe this happens because the page has not fully loaded yet and therefore it can't find certain elements.

Working with Selenium has been a rewarding challenge and I'd like to refine my abilities at making simple, automated tests like this in the future.
